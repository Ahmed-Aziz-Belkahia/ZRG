# Images Folder

This folder is intended for storing images used in the React application. You can organize images into subfolders if needed, such as `icons`, `backgrounds`, or `testimonials`. To reference these images in your code, use relative paths starting from the `src` directory.

Example:
```jsx
import testimonialImage from './assets/images/testimonial.jpg';

<img src={testimonialImage} alt="Testimonial" />
```
